=== Observed behaviour ===

Describe in general words the observed behaviour of each of these servers and 
how it affects the video playback experience. Then explain what you believe is
happening and what is causing the described behaviour.

* FUNKY A
- Slight stuttering in playback, but not enough to have a big impact on the 
  experience
- There is probably minor packet loss

* FUNKY B
- Heavy stuttering in playback, making it difficult to watch
- Lots of packets are probably being lost

* FUNKY C
- Video is skipping back and forth
- Some packets are probably arriving out of order

* FUNKY D
- Video has heavy stuttering and is skipping back and forth
- It is likely that lots of packets are being lost and others are arriving out 
  of order

* FUNKY E
- The video is playing too fast
- Packets are probably arriving faster than the client expects

* FUNKY F
- The video is playing too slowly
- Packets are probably arriving slower than the client expects

* FUNKY G
- Video is playing slowly and is stuttering
- Packets are probably arriving slowly than expected and some are being lost 
  completely

* FUNKY H
- Video hangs for a bit and then plays too fast for a bit
- Packets are probably arriving in clumps rather than spread evenly

=== Result of analysis ===

Explain in a few words what you believe is actually happening based on the statistics above.

* FUNKY A
- There is minor packet loss which is causing slight stuttering

* FUNKY B
- There is more significant packet loss which is causing more stuttering

* FUNKY C
- Some frames are arriving out of order, causing the video to skip back and forth

* FUNKY D
- There is significant packet loss and some packets are arriving out of order

* FUNKY E
- Packets are arriving faster than expected and a lot are being lost

* FUNKY F
- Packets are arriving very slowly

* FUNKY G
- Packets are arriving slowly and some are being lost

* FUNKY H
- The stats suggest that the only problem is slight packet loss, but the playback
  experience suggests that packets are clumped together
